### Manage Glossaries

When using DeepL API, you can add a glossary for [supported language pairs](https://developers.deepl.com/docs/api-reference/glossaries).
When translating, the plugin will search a glossary for the appropriate source and target language.
There can only be **one glossary for each language pair**.
